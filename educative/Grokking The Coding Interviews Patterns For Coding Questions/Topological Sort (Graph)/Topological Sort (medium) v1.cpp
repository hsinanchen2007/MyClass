Introduction
Topological Sort is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. 
For example, if event ‘B’ is dependent on event ‘A’, ‘A’ comes before ‘B’ in topological ordering.

This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a 
set of elements and then solves a few problems using it.

Let’s see this pattern in action.

Topological Sort of a directed graph (a graph with unidirectional edges) is a linear ordering of its 
vertices such that for every directed edge (U, V) from vertex U to vertex V, U comes before V in the 
ordering.

Given a directed graph, find the topological ordering of its vertices.

Example 1:

Input: Vertices=4, Edges=[3, 2], [3, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1]
Output: Following are the two valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 3, 2, 0, 1
2) 3, 2, 1, 0
    3   
    2   
    0   
    1   

Example 2:

Input: Vertices=5, Edges=[4, 2], [4, 3], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 1]
Output: Following are all valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 4, 2, 3, 0, 1
2) 4, 3, 2, 0, 1
3) 4, 3, 2, 1, 0
4) 4, 2, 3, 1, 0
5) 4, 2, 0, 3, 1
    4   
    2   
    3   
    0   
    1

Example 3:

Input: Vertices=7, Edges=[6, 4], [6, 2], [5, 3], [5, 4], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1]
Output: Following are all valid topological sorts for the given graph:
1) 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2
2) 6, 5, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2
3) 5, 6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1
4) 6, 5, 4, 3, 0, 1, 2
5) 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1
6) 5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0

There are other valid topological ordering of the graph too.
    6   
    4   
    2   
    1   
    5   
    3   
    0
