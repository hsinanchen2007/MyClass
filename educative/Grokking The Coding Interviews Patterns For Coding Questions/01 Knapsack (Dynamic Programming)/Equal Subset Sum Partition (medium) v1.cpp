Given a set of positive numbers, find if we can partition it into two subsets such that the 
sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1:

Input: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 4} & {2, 3}

Example 2:

Input: {1, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: True
Explanation: The given set can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum: {1, 3, 4} & {1, 7}

Example 3:

Input: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Output: False
Explanation: The given set cannot be partitioned into two subsets with equal sum.

Basic Solution
This problem follows the 0/1 Knapsack pattern. A basic brute-force solution could be to try all 
combinations of partitioning the given numbers into two sets to see if any pair of sets has an 
equal sum.

Assume that S represents the total sum of all the given numbers. Then the two equal subsets must 
have a sum equal to S/2. This essentially transforms our problem to: "Find a subset of the given 
numbers that has a total sum of S/2".

So our brute-force algorithm will look like:

Time and Space complexity
The time complexity of the above algorithm is exponential O(2^n), where ‘n’ represents the total 
number. The space complexity is O(n), which will be used to store the recursion stack.
