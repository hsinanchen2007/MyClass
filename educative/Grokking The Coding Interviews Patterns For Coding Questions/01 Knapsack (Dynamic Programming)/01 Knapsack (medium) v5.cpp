How can we find the selected items?
As we know, the final profit is at the bottom-right corner. Therefore, we will start from 
there to find the items that will be going into the knapsack.

As you remember, at every step, we had two options: include an item or skip it. If we skip 
an item, we take the profit from the remaining items (i.e., from the cell right above it); 
if we include the item, then we jump to the remaining profit to find more items.

Let’s understand this from the above example:

widget
‘22’ did not come from the top cell (which is 17); hence we must include the item at index 
‘3’ (which is item ‘D’).
Subtract the profit of item ‘D’ from ‘22’ to get the remaining profit ‘6’. We then jump to 
profit ‘6’ on the same row.
‘6’ came from the top cell, so we jump to row ‘2’.
Again, ‘6’ came from the top cell, so we jump to row ‘1’.
‘6’ is different from the top cell, so we must include this item (which is item ‘B’).
Subtract the profit of ‘B’ from ‘6’ to get profit ‘0’. We then jump to profit ‘0’ on the same 
row. As soon as we hit zero remaining profit, we can finish our item search.
Thus, the items going into the knapsack are {B, D}.
Let’s write a function to print the set of items included in the knapsack.
