Takeaway Skills
    Understand the essential patterns behind common coding interview questions — without having to drill 
    endless problem sets

    Identify the underlying pattern of each interview question by assessing the problem statement (and learn 
    the tricks required to solve it)

    Practice your skills in a hands-on, setup-free coding environment

    Learn to efficiently evaluate the tradeoffs between time and space complexity in different solutions

    Develop a flexible conceptual framework for solving any question, by connecting problem characteristics, 
    solution techniques, and coding design patterns

Course Overview
    With thousands of potential questions to account for, preparing for the coding interview can feel like an 
    impossible challenge. Yet with a strategic approach, coding interview prep doesn’t have to take more than 
    a few weeks. Stop drilling endless sets of practice problems, and prepare ...See More

    How You'll Learn
    Hands-on coding environments
