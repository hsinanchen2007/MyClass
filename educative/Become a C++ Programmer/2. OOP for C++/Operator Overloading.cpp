Operator Overloading
C++ allows us to overload operators. Let's find out how.

Definition 
C++ allows us to define the behavior of operators for our own data types. This is known as 
operator overloading.

Operators vary in nature and therefore, require different operands. The number of operands 
for a particular operator depends on:

the kind of operator (infix, prefix, etc.)

whether the operator is a method or function.

struct Account{
  Account& operator += (double b){
    balance += b;
    return *this; }....
};

...
Account a;
a += 100.0;
We have already encountered function overloading. If the function is inside a class, it must 
be declared as a friend and all its arguments must be provided.

Rules 
To achieve perfect operator overloading, there is a large set of rules we have to follow. 
Here are some of the important ones.

We cannot change the precedence of an operator. The compiler computes all operators in order 
of precedence. We cannot alter this order. Hence, whatever operation our operator performs, 
it will be computed after the operator with higher precedence.

Derived classes inherit all the operators of their base classes except the assignment operator. 
Each class needs to overload the = operator.

All operators other than the function call operator cannot have default arguments.

Operators can be called explicitly. A benefit of overloading an operator is that it can be 
used directly with its operands. However, the compiler may cause some implicit conversion in 
this process. We can make explicit calls to the overloaded operator in the following format: 
a.operator += (b).

The += operator is being overloaded for the Account class in lines 8 to 10. Now, we can add 
and assign a double to an Account object without any problems. However, this will not support 
Account += Account, where both operands are of the Account type.

For this purpose, we declare a friend function in line 13 to support the additional assignment 
between two Account objects. The friend function can access the private member, balance. Hence, 
we can perform a.balance + b.balance. The function has been implemented in lines 21 to 24.

The << output operator has also been overloaded in a friend function on lines 26 to 29. Now, 
std::cout << acc; will print the balance of the acc object.

From lines 39 to 43, we can see examples of the additional assignment working between the Account 
and double types.

One thing to note is that the explicit operator call works when the argument is a double, as seen 
in line 45.

However, the call would not work for the Account argument in line 46. This is because the class 
doesnâ€™t support the conversion from Account to double.

#include <iostream>

class Account{

public:
  explicit Account(double b): balance(b){}

  Account& operator += (double b){
    balance += b;
    return * this;
  }

  friend Account& operator += (Account& a, Account& b);
  friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, const Account& a);

private:
  double balance;

};

Account& operator += (Account& a, Account& b){
   a.balance += b.balance;
   return a;
 }

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, const Account& a){
   os << a.balance;
   return os;
}

int main(){

  std::cout << std::endl;

  Account acc1(100.0);
  Account acc2(100.0);
  Account acc3(100.0);

  acc1 += 50.0;
  acc1 += acc1;

  acc2 += 50.0;
  acc2 += acc2;

  acc3.operator += (50.0);
  //acc3.operator += (acc3);   ERROR

  std::cout << "acc1: " << acc1 << std::endl;
  std::cout << "acc2: " << acc2 << std::endl;

  std::cout << std::endl;

}
