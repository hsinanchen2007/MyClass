Explanation
We have implemented both a Base and a Derived class. Derived is publicly inherited from Base and may, 
therefore, use in its method callAllBaseFunctions in line 24, the methods func1, func2, and func3 from 
the Base class.

Make the name dependent: The call this->func1 in line 25 is dependent. The name lookup will consider in 
this case all base classes.

Introduce the name into the current scope: The expression using Base<T>::func2 (line 22) introduces func2 
into the current scope.

Call the name fully qualified: Calling func3 fully qualified (line 27) will break a virtual dispatch and 
may cause new surprises.

We have created a Derived class object named derived. By using this object, we can access the base class 
functions by calling the method callAllBaseFunctions.
