std::variant
The last part of this section deals with std::variant which allows us to create a variable 
from any of the types specified in the std::variant container.

std::variant is a type-safe union. An instance of std::variant has a value from one of its 
types. The type must not be a reference, array or void. A std::variant can have a type more 
than once. A default-initialised std::variant is initialised with its first type; therefore, 
its first type must have a default constructor. By using var.index you get the zero-based 
index of the alternative held by the std::variant var. var.valueless_by_exception returns 
false if the variant holds a value. By using var.emplace you can create a new value in-place. 
There are a few global functions used to access a std:variant. The function template var.holds_alternative 
lets you check if the std::variant holds a specified alternative. You can use std::get with 
an index and with a type as argument. By using an index, you will get the value. If you invoke 
std::get with a type, you only will get the value if it is unique. If you use an invalid index 
or a non-unique type, you will get a std::bad_variant_access exception. In contrast to std::get 
which eventually returns an exception, std::get_if returns a null pointer in the case of an error.

The following code snippet shows you the usage of a std::variant.

v and w are two variants. Both can have an int and a float value. Their default value is 0. v 
becomes 12 and the following call std::get<int>(v) returns the value. The next three lines show 
three possibilities to assign the variant v to w, but you have to keep a few rules in mind. 
You can ask for the value of a variant by type std::get<double>(v) or by index: std::get<3>(v). 
The type must be unique and the index valid. The variant w holds an int value; therefore, I get 
a std::bad_variant_access exception if I ask for a float type. If the constructor call or assignment 
call is unambiguous, a conversion can take place. This is the reason that itâ€™s possible to construct 
a std::variant<std::string> from a C-string or assign a new C-string to the variant.

std::variant has an interesting non-member function std::visit that allows you to execute a callable 
on a list of variants. A callable is something which you can invoke. Typically this can be a function, 
a function object, or lambda expression. For simplicity reasons, I use a lambda function in this example.
