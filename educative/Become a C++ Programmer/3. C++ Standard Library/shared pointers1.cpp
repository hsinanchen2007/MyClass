Introduction
std::shared_ptr shares ownership of the resource. They have two handles: one for the resource, 
and one for the reference counter. By copying an std::shared_ptr, the reference count is increased 
by one. It is decreased by one if the std::shared_ptr goes out of scope. If the reference counter 
becomes the value 0, the C++ runtime automatically releases the resource, since there is no longer 
an std::shared_ptr referencing the resource. The release of the resource occurs exactly when the 
last std::shared_ptr goes out of scope. The C++ runtime guarantees that the call of the reference 
counter is an atomic operation. Due to this management, std::shared_ptr consumes more time and memory 
than a raw pointer or std::unique_ptr.

Take a look at the image below to better visualize the concept.

Due to shared1, shared2 is initialized. In the end, the reference count is 2 and both smart pointers 
have the same resource.

Methods
In the following table, we will see the methods of std::shared_ptr.

Name	Description
get	Returns a pointer to the resource.
get_deleter	Returns the delete function.
reset	Resets the resource.
swap	Swaps the resources.
unique	Checks if the std::shared_ptr is the exclusive owner of the resource.
use_count	Returns the value of the reference counter.
Methods of std::shared_ptr

std::make_shared
The helper function std::make_shared creates the resource and returns it in an std::shared_ptr. Use 
std::make_shared rather than directly creating an std::shared_ptr because std::make_shared is much faster. 
Additionally, such as in the case of std::make_unique, std::make_shared guarantees no memory leaks.

std::shared_ptr from this
This unique technique, in which a class derives from a class template having itself as a parameter, is called 
CRTP and stands for Curiously Recurring Template Pattern.

Using the class std::enable_shared_from_this, we can create objects that return an std::shared_ptr to themselves. 
To do so, we must publicly derive the class from std::enable_shared_from_this. So the class ShareMe support 
the method shared_from_this, and return std::shared_ptr:

The smart pointer shareMe (line 17) is copied by shareMe1 (line 18) and shareMe2 (line 20), and all of them

reference the very same resource.
increment and decrement the reference counter.
The call shareMe->getShared() in line 18 creates a new smart pointer. getShared() (line 9) internally uses the 
function shared_from_this.

// enableShared.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class ShareMe: public std::enable_shared_from_this<ShareMe>{
public:
  std::shared_ptr<ShareMe> getShared(){
    return shared_from_this();
  }
};

int main(){

  std::cout << std::endl;

  std::shared_ptr<ShareMe> shareMe(new ShareMe);
  std::shared_ptr<ShareMe> shareMe1= shareMe->getShared();
  {
    auto shareMe2(shareMe1);
    std::cout << "shareMe.use_count(): "  << shareMe.use_count() << std::endl;
  }
  std::cout << "shareMe.use_count(): "  << shareMe.use_count() << std::endl;
  
  shareMe1.reset();
  
  std::cout << "shareMe.use_count(): "  << shareMe.use_count() << std::endl;

  std::cout << std::endl;

}

// shareMe.use_count(): 3
// shareMe.use_count(): 2
// shareMe.use_count(): 1
