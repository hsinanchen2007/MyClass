Requirements
You do not need to have any prior knowledge of programming. This is for absolute beginners.
You only need to know how to create a folder and how to save files in folder in any operating system like Mac or Windows.
You can start writing C++ program using any text editor like Notepad or Notepad++ or Sublime text or Atom
You can also use advance IDEs like Visual Studio or Xcode or Code::Blocks - I will demonstrate how to download and install each of them - No Worries.
You will also need C++ compiler - I will demonstrate how to install C++ compiler on your system at the beginning.
You can also use online C++ compiler to compile and execute your program.
