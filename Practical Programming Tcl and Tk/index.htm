<h2>Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk, 4th ed</h2>
This CD-ROM contains software and documentation for Tcl/Tk
extensions and applications.  It also contains
all the examples from the book. To stay up-to-date with
Tcl/Tk and this book, please visit:

<h2>Tcl/Tk Distributions</h2>
There are 4 kinds of Tcl/Tk distributions on the CD-ROM.
<ul>
<li>The <a href=tcl8_3>tcl8_3</a> and <a href=tcl8_4>tcl8_4</a>
directories contain the source distributions for recent
Tcl versions.  The latest on this CD-ROM is Tcl/Tk 8.4.2.
There are <a href=tcl8_4/html/contents.htm>Manual Pages</a>
for Tcl and Tk commands and C APIs.

<li>The <a href=ActiveTcl>ActiveTcl</a> directory contains
pre-compiled binary distributions created by
<a href=http://www.activestate.com>ActiveState</a>.
This includes the TclDevKit professional toolkit, which includes
a debugger, syntax checker, and more.
ActiveTcl is free, and the distribution comes with many extensions
already configured. 
<a href=http://www.activestate.com/Products/Tcl_Dev_Kit/>TclDevKit</a> requires a license, and you can
visit the ActiveState web site to obtain a trail license.

<font size=-1>ActiveTcl is a trademark of ActiveState Corporation</font>

<li>The <a href=tclkit8.4.2>tclkit8.4.2</a> directory contains
pre-compiled binaries for the Tclkit application, which
is an extended Tcl/Tk shell used to create Starkits.
You can also use Tclkit just like Wish or Tclsh, and it comes
as a self-contained, single file that is quite convenient.
The <a href=tclkit8.4.1>tclkit8.4.1</a> directory contains
Tclkit builds for additional platforms, including Macintosh,
that were not yet available for 8.4.2 when this CD was assembled.
There are also complete sources and instructions for building
Tclkit yourself.

<li>The <a href=handheld>handheld</a> directory contains Tcl variants
that have been created for small handheld devices.  These are
fairly experimental, but I can reccommend the Toucan development
environment for creating Tcl apps on PalmOS.
</ul>
<h2>Starkits</h2>
The <a href=sdarchive/index.htm>sdarchive</a> directory contains quite a lot
of Starkits, which are packaged Tcl/Tk extensions or applications that
are designed to work with Tclkit.  Starkits are a great packaging and
deployment technology for Tcl/Tk applications.  There is a new book
chapter on them.
<h2>TclHttpd</h2>
The <a href=tclhttpd3.4.3>tclhttpd3.4.3</a> directory contains the TclHttpd
distribution.  You should be able to run the server directly from
this location with a command like:
<pre>
tclsh8.3 /mnt/cdrom/tclbook4/tclhttpd3.4.3/bin/httpd.tcl
tclsh83 D:\tclhttpd3.4.3\bin\httpd.tcl
</pre>
<h2>Book Examples</h2>
The <a href=exsource>exsource</a> folder contains one file for
each example, plus a few sample applications made by assembling
some of the examples into one file.  You are free to use this sample
code for any purpose.
<h2>The Tcler's Wiki</h2>
This <a href=wiki>wiki</a> directory
contains a stand-alone copy of the Tcler's Wiki
web site, <a href=http://mini.net/tcl>wiki.tcl.tk</a>.  To browse
it locally, use the wikit.kit starkit like this:
<pre>
tclkit wiki/wikit.kit wiki/wikit.tkd -readonly
</pre>
<h2>Free Tcl/Tk Software</h2>
There are more extensions and applications
distributed as <tt>.zip</tt> or <tt>.tar.gz</tt>
source distributions.  Some are purely Tcl scripts.  Others require
a compiler to create binary extensions from C code.  The
<a href=mingw>mingw</a> folder contains a free C compiler for Windows.
On UNIX systems you can use the free gcc compiler or the compiler distributed
by your vendor.
The following directories contain Tcl/Tk applications and extensions.
<ul>
<li><a href=applications>applications</a>
<li><a href=extensions>extensions</a>
</ul>
